‚óè I've optimized the CLAUDE.md file for your AutoDevHub project. The key improvements include:

  1. Project-Specific Context: Added clear project description and tech stack (FastAPI, React, Docker)
  2. Specialized Agent Roles: Replaced generic roles with project-specific ones:
    - backend-dev for FastAPI development
    - frontend-dev for React/TypeScript work
    - security-analyst for defensive security
    - devops-engineer for CI/CD and Docker
  3. Quick Commands: Added frequently used commands for both backend and frontend development
  4. Task Templates: Created specific workflows for common tasks like API endpoint creation and React component development
  5. Security Guidelines: Added project-specific security practices including JWT auth, Pydantic validation, and SQLAlchemy ORM usage
  6. Code Patterns: Included actual code examples following your project's structure
  7. Quality Checks: Defined specific commands to run before completing tasks
  8. Memory Keys: Standardized keys for storing insights across sessions

  The configuration is now tailored to AutoDevHub's architecture and development workflow, making it more efficient for AI assistance with your specific project needs.
