### 2.2 User Stories (Gherkin Format)

#### Epic 1: AI-Powered Story Generation

```gherkin
Feature: Automated User Story Generation
  As a Product Manager
  I want to input high-level feature descriptions
  So that I can automatically generate detailed user stories in Gherkin format

  Scenario: Generate user story from feature description
    Given I am on the AutoDevHub dashboard
    When I input the feature description "User authentication with social login"
    And I click "Generate Story"
    Then I should see a complete user story with acceptance criteria
    And the story should be formatted in proper Gherkin syntax
    And the story should include relevant test scenarios

  Scenario: Refine generated user story
    Given I have a generated user story
    When I provide feedback "Add two-factor authentication"
    And I click "Refine Story"
    Then the story should be updated with 2FA requirements
    And new acceptance criteria should be added
    And test scenarios should be updated accordingly
```

#### Epic 2: Live Documentation Management

```gherkin
Feature: Automated Documentation Updates
  As a Development Team Lead
  I want documentation to update automatically when code changes
  So that our documentation is always accurate and current

  Scenario: Auto-update API documentation
    Given I have an API endpoint with documentation
    When I modify the endpoint signature in code
    And I commit the changes
    Then the API documentation should automatically update
    And the changes should be reflected in GitHub Pages
    And team members should be notified of the updates

  Scenario: Generate architecture diagrams
    Given I have a new system component
    When I add it to the codebase
    Then a system architecture diagram should be generated
    And component relationships should be visualized
    And the diagram should be added to documentation
```

#### Epic 3: AI-Powered Code Review

```gherkin
Feature: Intelligent Code Review Automation
  As a Software Developer
  I want AI to review my code before human review
  So that I can catch issues early and improve code quality

  Scenario: Automated code quality check
    Given I create a pull request
    When the AI reviewer analyzes my code
    Then I should receive feedback on code quality
    And security vulnerabilities should be identified
    And performance optimization suggestions should be provided
    And coding standards compliance should be verified

  Scenario: Automated test generation suggestions
    Given I add a new function to the codebase
    When the AI reviewer analyzes the changes
    Then test case suggestions should be generated
    And edge cases should be identified
    And test coverage recommendations should be provided
```
