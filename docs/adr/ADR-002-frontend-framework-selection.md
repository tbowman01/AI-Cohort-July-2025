# ADR-002: Frontend Framework Selection (React)

## Status
Accepted

## Context
AutoDevHub requires a dynamic frontend that can handle user input for feature descriptions, display generated Gherkin stories, and provide real-time feedback during AI processing. The frontend framework must:

- Enable rapid UI development within 8-hour timeline
- Support real-time updates during story generation
- Provide good developer experience with hot reloading
- Handle asynchronous API calls to backend services
- Support component-based architecture for maintainability
- Integrate well with modern build tools and deployment platforms

The application needs to be responsive and provide immediate visual feedback when users submit feature descriptions for AI-powered story generation.

## Decision
We will use React with Vite as the frontend framework for AutoDevHub.

React with Vite provides:
- **Component-based architecture** - Reusable UI components for story input/display
- **Virtual DOM** - Efficient updates when displaying generated stories
- **Large ecosystem** - Extensive library support for UI components and utilities
- **Vite build tool** - Extremely fast development server and hot module replacement
- **Modern JavaScript** - ES6+ features and excellent developer experience
- **Easy API integration** - Built-in fetch API and useState hooks for backend communication

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- **Rapid Development**: Component reusability speeds up UI implementation
- **Hot Reloading**: Vite provides instant feedback during development
- **State Management**: React hooks simplify state management for story generation workflow
- **Large Community**: Extensive documentation and community support
- **Modern Tooling**: Vite provides excellent build performance and development experience
- **Deployment Ready**: Easy integration with Vercel, Netlify, or static hosting

### Negative Consequences
- **Bundle Size**: React adds overhead compared to vanilla JavaScript
- **Complexity**: May be overkill for simple story generation interface
- **SEO Limitations**: Client-side rendering may impact search engine optimization

### Risks
- **State Synchronization**: Managing state between story input and AI-generated output
- **Error Handling**: Properly handling and displaying API errors from backend
- **Performance**: Ensuring smooth UI during potentially slow AI generation requests

## Alternatives Considered

### Vue.js
- **Pros**: Gentler learning curve, excellent performance, good documentation
- **Cons**: Smaller ecosystem compared to React, less team familiarity
- **Rejection Reason**: Team has more React experience for rapid development

### Svelte/SvelteKit
- **Pros**: Compile-time optimizations, smaller bundle size, simple syntax
- **Cons**: Smaller ecosystem, less team familiarity, newer framework
- **Rejection Reason**: Learning curve would impact 8-hour development timeline

### Vanilla JavaScript
- **Pros**: No framework overhead, complete control, faster loading
- **Cons**: More boilerplate code, manual DOM manipulation, harder to maintain
- **Rejection Reason**: Would slow down development, harder to manage component state

### Angular
- **Pros**: Full-featured framework, excellent TypeScript support, enterprise-ready
- **Cons**: Steep learning curve, heavy framework, complex setup
- **Rejection Reason**: Too complex for simple story generation interface

### Next.js
- **Pros**: React-based with SSR, excellent developer experience, built-in optimizations
- **Cons**: Additional complexity, server-side rendering not needed for this use case
- **Rejection Reason**: Overkill for simple client-side story generation tool

## Implementation Notes
- Use React functional components with hooks for state management
- Implement useState for story input and generated output
- Use useEffect for API calls to backend story generation service
- Leverage Vite's fast refresh for rapid development iteration
- Implement loading states and error handling for AI service calls
- Use modern CSS or styled-components for responsive design
