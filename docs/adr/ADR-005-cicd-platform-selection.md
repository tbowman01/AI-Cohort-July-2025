# ADR-005: CI/CD Platform Selection (GitHub Actions)

## Status
Accepted

## Context
AutoDevHub requires automated continuous integration and deployment to demonstrate modern DevOps practices and AI-assisted development workflows. The CI/CD platform must:

- Integrate seamlessly with GitHub repository hosting
- Support automated testing of both frontend and backend components
- Enable AI-powered code review and quality analysis
- Deploy documentation automatically to GitHub Pages
- Handle secrets management for API keys and deployment credentials
- Provide cost-effective solution for educational/demonstration purposes
- Support the 8-hour development timeline with minimal setup overhead

The platform should showcase AI integration within the development pipeline, including automated code review and documentation updates.

## Decision
We will use GitHub Actions as the CI/CD platform for AutoDevHub.

GitHub Actions provides:
- **Native GitHub integration** - Seamless trigger on repository events
- **Matrix builds** - Test across multiple Python and Node.js versions
- **Secrets management** - Secure storage of API keys and deployment credentials
- **GitHub Pages integration** - Automatic documentation deployment  
- **AI integration support** - Compatible with Claude Code Action and similar tools
- **Cost effectiveness** - Free tier sufficient for educational projects
- **YAML configuration** - Infrastructure as code with version control

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- **Zero Setup Time**: Already integrated with GitHub repository
- **Native Secrets**: Secure ANTHROPIC_API_KEY storage without external tools
- **Pages Integration**: Automatic documentation deployment to GitHub Pages
- **Matrix Testing**: Test across multiple environments automatically
- **AI Workflow Support**: Easy integration with Claude Code Action for AI code review
- **Version Control**: All CI/CD configuration stored in repository
- **Community**: Large ecosystem of pre-built actions

### Negative Consequences
- **GitHub Lock-in**: Tightly coupled to GitHub ecosystem
- **Limited Resources**: GitHub-hosted runners have resource constraints
- **Queue Times**: Potential delays during peak usage periods
- **Vendor Dependency**: Relies on GitHub service availability

### Risks
- **Action Marketplace**: Dependency on third-party actions for specialized functionality
- **API Rate Limits**: GitHub API limits may affect complex workflows
- **Secret Exposure**: Risk of accidental secret exposure in logs
- **Build Minutes**: Usage limits on free tier (though generous for this project)

## Alternatives Considered

### Jenkins
- **Pros**: Highly customizable, self-hosted control, extensive plugin ecosystem
- **Cons**: Complex setup, maintenance overhead, infrastructure requirements
- **Rejection Reason**: Too much setup time for 8-hour development constraint

### GitLab CI/CD
- **Pros**: Integrated with GitLab, good Docker support, pipeline visualization
- **Cons**: Would require GitLab migration, different workflow patterns
- **Rejection Reason**: Project already uses GitHub, migration would waste time

### CircleCI
- **Pros**: Good performance, Docker-first approach, advanced features
- **Cons**: Additional service dependency, learning curve, cost considerations
- **Rejection Reason**: GitHub Actions sufficient for project needs

### Azure DevOps
- **Pros**: Microsoft ecosystem integration, robust features, good scalability
- **Cons**: Complex interface, overkill for simple project, additional account needed
- **Rejection Reason**: Too complex for demonstration project scope

## Implementation Strategy

### Workflow Structure
```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI/CD Pipeline
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test-backend:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: [3.9, 3.10, 3.11]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      - run: pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
      - run: pytest backend/tests/
      - run: bandit -r backend/src/

  test-frontend:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - run: npm install
        working-directory: frontend
      - run: npm test
        working-directory: frontend
      - run: npm run build
        working-directory: frontend

  ai-code-review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@beta
        with:
          api-key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
          mode: review

  deploy-docs:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    needs: [test-backend, test-frontend]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      - run: npm run build:docs
      - uses: actions/deploy-pages@v2
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          artifact_name: docs
```

### Security Configuration
- Store `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in repository secrets
- Use `GITHUB_TOKEN` for Pages deployment
- Implement proper secret handling in workflows
- Regular rotation of API keys and tokens

### Quality Gates
- All tests must pass before merge
- Security scan (Bandit) must pass
- AI code review must complete successfully
- Documentation must build without errors

### Monitoring and Alerts
- Workflow status badges in README
- Email notifications for failed builds
- Integration with GitHub mobile app for real-time alerts
- Slack webhook integration for team notifications (future enhancement)
