# ADR-007: Development Environment (GitHub Codespaces)

## Status
Accepted

## Context
AutoDevHub development requires a consistent, quickly accessible environment that supports the 8-hour development timeline. The development environment must:

- Provide immediate access without local setup overhead
- Support both Python backend and React frontend development
- Include all necessary tools for AI integration and API development
- Enable collaborative development and code sharing
- Support integrated terminal, debugging, and version control
- Work reliably with GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- Allow for easy demonstration and presentation preparation

The choice directly impacts development velocity and the ability to meet aggressive timeline constraints.

## Decision
We will use GitHub Codespaces as the primary development environment for AutoDevHub.

GitHub Codespaces provides:
- **Zero setup time** - Cloud-based environment ready in seconds
- **Consistent configuration** - Same environment for all team members
- **Full VS Code experience** - Complete IDE with extensions and debugging
- **Integrated tools** - Git, terminal, port forwarding built-in
- **GitHub integration** - Seamless commit, push, and CI/CD workflow
- **Resource scaling** - Choose appropriate CPU/memory for development needs
- **Collaboration features** - Live sharing and pair programming capabilities

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- **Immediate Productivity**: No time wasted on environment setup
- **Consistency**: Identical development environment across team and demonstrations
- **Cloud Resources**: Access to powerful computing resources regardless of local hardware
- **Integrated Workflow**: Seamless integration with GitHub repository and Actions
- **Collaboration**: Easy code sharing and pair programming during development
- **Backup**: Work automatically saved to cloud, no risk of local data loss
- **Demonstration Ready**: Environment accessible from any device for presentations

### Negative Consequences
- **Internet Dependency**: Requires stable internet connection for development
- **Usage Costs**: Consumes GitHub Codespaces minutes (though generous free tier)
- **Performance Variability**: Network latency may affect responsiveness
- **Limited Offline Work**: Cannot work without internet connectivity

### Risks
- **Service Outages**: GitHub Codespaces unavailability would halt development
- **Resource Limits**: Free tier limitations might require paid upgrade
- **Data Synchronization**: Potential issues with file synchronization
- **Browser Dependency**: Performance tied to browser and internet speed

## Alternatives Considered

### Local Development
- **Pros**: Full control, no internet dependency, familiar environment
- **Cons**: Setup time, environment inconsistencies, potential compatibility issues
- **Rejection Reason**: Setup time would consume significant portion of 8-hour timeline

### Docker Development Containers
- **Pros**: Consistent environment, reproducible builds, good for CI/CD
- **Cons**: Requires Docker setup, additional complexity, learning curve
- **Rejection Reason**: More complex than Codespaces, longer setup time

### Replit
- **Pros**: Browser-based, collaborative, quick setup
- **Cons**: Less powerful than Codespaces, limited customization, different workflow
- **Rejection Reason**: Less integrated with GitHub workflow

### GitPod
- **Pros**: Similar to Codespaces, good GitHub integration, flexible configuration
- **Cons**: Additional service dependency, different from GitHub ecosystem
- **Rejection Reason**: Codespaces offers better GitHub integration

### Cloud IDEs (Cloud9, etc.)
- **Pros**: Cloud-based development, scalable resources
- **Cons**: Additional setup, different toolchain, migration overhead
- **Rejection Reason**: Codespaces provides better GitHub integration

## Implementation Strategy

### Codespace Configuration
```json
// .devcontainer/devcontainer.json
{
  "name": "AutoDevHub Development",
  "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/universal:2",
  "features": {
    "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/python:1": {
      "version": "3.11"
    },
    "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/node:1": {
      "version": "18"
    }
  },
  "customizations": {
    "vscode": {
      "extensions": [
        "ms-python.python",
        "ms-python.black-formatter",
        "ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-next",
        "bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss",
        "ms-vscode.vscode-json",
        "redhat.vscode-yaml"
      ],
      "settings": {
        "python.defaultInterpreterPath": "/usr/local/bin/python",
        "python.formatting.provider": "black"
      }
    }
  },
  "forwardPorts": [3000, 8000],
  "postCreateCommand": "pip install -r requirements.txt && npm install",
  "remoteUser": "codespace"
}
```

### Development Workflow
1. **Start Codespace**: Launch from GitHub repository in seconds
2. **Environment Setup**: Automatic installation of dependencies via postCreateCommand
3. **Development**: Full VS Code experience with integrated terminal
4. **Testing**: Run frontend and backend servers with port forwarding
5. **Commit/Push**: Integrated Git workflow directly from Codespace
6. **CI/CD**: Automatic trigger of GitHub Actions on push

### Resource Management
- **Machine Type**: 4-core, 8GB RAM for balanced performance
- **Disk Space**: Monitor usage to stay within limits
- **Timeout Settings**: Configure appropriate idle timeout
- **Cost Monitoring**: Track usage against free tier limits

### Collaboration Features
- **Live Share**: Real-time collaborative editing
- **Port Forwarding**: Share running applications for review
- **Terminal Sharing**: Collaborative debugging and problem-solving
- **Code Reviews**: Integrated PR creation and review workflow

### Backup and Recovery
- All code automatically synchronized with GitHub repository
- Regular commits ensure work is never lost
- Codespace environment can be recreated instantly
- Export capability for local development if needed
