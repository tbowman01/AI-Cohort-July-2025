# ADR-001: Backend Framework Selection (FastAPI)

## Status
Accepted

## Context
AutoDevHub is an AI-powered DevOps tracker that needs to generate and serve user stories, integrate with AI services, and provide real-time API responses. The backend framework must:

- Support rapid development to meet 8-hour implementation timeline
- Provide automatic API documentation generation for AI integration
- Handle asynchronous operations for AI service calls
- Offer built-in data validation and serialization
- Enable easy testing and deployment
- Support modern Python development practices

The project requires tight integration with Claude AI for story generation, real-time user interactions, and comprehensive API documentation for both human developers and AI agents.

## Decision
We will use FastAPI as the backend framework for AutoDevHub.

FastAPI provides:
- **Automatic OpenAPI documentation** - Critical for AI agents to understand API structure
- **Built-in async/await support** - Essential for AI service integration without blocking
- **Pydantic integration** - Automatic request/response validation and serialization
- **High performance** - Comparable to Node.js and Go for API responses
- **Type hints** - Better code quality and IDE support for rapid development
- **Minimal boilerplate** - Faster implementation within time constraints

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- **Rapid Development**: Minimal setup required, can have API running in minutes
- **Auto-Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger docs generated automatically for AI integration
- **Type Safety**: Pydantic models prevent runtime errors during AI service calls
- **Async Performance**: Non-blocking AI API calls improve user experience
- **Testing Support**: Built-in test client simplifies test-driven development
- **Modern Python**: Leverages latest Python features for cleaner code

### Negative Consequences
- **Learning Curve**: Team members unfamiliar with async Python may need time to adapt
- **Dependency Management**: Requires careful management of async dependencies
- **Debugging Complexity**: Async code can be harder to debug than synchronous alternatives

### Risks
- **AI Service Timeouts**: Must implement proper timeout handling for Claude AI calls
- **Concurrent User Load**: Need to handle multiple simultaneous story generation requests
- **Error Propagation**: Async errors from AI services must be properly handled

## Alternatives Considered

### Django REST Framework
- **Pros**: Mature ecosystem, excellent admin interface, comprehensive features
- **Cons**: Synchronous by default, more complex setup, heavier for simple API needs
- **Rejection Reason**: Too much overhead for 8-hour development timeline

### Flask
- **Pros**: Simple, lightweight, familiar to many developers
- **Cons**: Requires additional packages for async support, manual API documentation
- **Rejection Reason**: Would require more setup time for async AI integration

### Express.js (Node.js)
- **Pros**: Fast development, large ecosystem, natural async support
- **Cons**: JavaScript/TypeScript instead of Python, different deployment considerations
- **Rejection Reason**: Team expertise is Python-focused, AI libraries primarily Python-based

### Tornado
- **Pros**: Built for async operations, good performance
- **Cons**: More complex API design, less modern development experience
- **Rejection Reason**: Less intuitive than FastAPI, smaller community

## Implementation Notes
- Use async/await for all AI service calls to Claude API
- Implement comprehensive error handling for AI service failures  
- Leverage automatic OpenAPI docs for frontend development and AI agent integration
- Use Pydantic models for all request/response validation
- Implement health checks for monitoring deployment status
