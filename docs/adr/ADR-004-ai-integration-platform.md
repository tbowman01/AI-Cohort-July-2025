# ADR-004: AI Integration Platform (Claude AI)

## Status
Accepted

## Context
AutoDevHub's core functionality revolves around AI-powered generation of user stories from feature descriptions. The AI integration must:

- Generate high-quality Gherkin scenarios from natural language feature descriptions
- Provide consistent, structured output for user story formatting
- Handle various types of feature requests with appropriate context understanding
- Support API integration for real-time story generation
- Maintain reasonable response times for user experience
- Offer reliable service availability for demonstration and production use

The AI platform choice directly impacts the quality of generated stories, user experience, and overall project success within the 8-hour development timeline.

## Decision
We will use Claude AI (Anthropic) as the primary AI platform for AutoDevHub.

Claude AI provides:
- **Superior reasoning capabilities** - Better understanding of software requirements and user needs
- **Structured output generation** - Consistent Gherkin format generation with proper syntax
- **Context awareness** - Understanding of software development concepts and Agile practices
- **API availability** - RESTful API for integration with FastAPI backend
- **Rate limiting** - Reasonable usage limits for development and demonstration
- **Quality consistency** - Reliable output quality across different types of feature requests

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- **High-Quality Output**: Claude excels at understanding context and generating well-structured Gherkin scenarios
- **Development Efficiency**: Superior code understanding helps with implementation assistance
- **Consistent Format**: Reliable generation of properly formatted user stories
- **Documentation Integration**: Can assist with generating project documentation and ADRs
- **API Integration**: Straightforward REST API integration with FastAPI
- **Cost Effectiveness**: Reasonable pricing for prototype and demonstration usage

### Negative Consequences
- **API Dependency**: Application functionality depends on external service availability
- **Rate Limiting**: May encounter usage limits during high-volume testing
- **Cost Scaling**: Costs increase with usage volume in production deployment
- **Latency**: Network requests add response time compared to local processing

### Risks
- **Service Outages**: Claude API unavailability would break core functionality
- **Rate Limits**: Exceeding API limits during development or demonstration
- **Response Variability**: Potential inconsistency in output format or quality
- **API Changes**: Breaking changes to Claude API could require code updates

## Alternatives Considered

### OpenAI GPT-4
- **Pros**: Well-established API, large community, extensive documentation
- **Cons**: Higher cost, potential quality variations, content filtering limitations
- **Rejection Reason**: Claude shows superior performance for structured text generation

### Local LLM (Ollama/llama.cpp)
- **Pros**: No external dependencies, no usage costs, complete control
- **Cons**: Resource intensive, longer inference times, complex setup
- **Rejection Reason**: Would exceed time constraints and resource requirements

### Google Gemini
- **Pros**: Google ecosystem integration, competitive performance
- **Cons**: Less proven for structured output, different API patterns
- **Rejection Reason**: Less experience with Gemini API, Claude more suitable for text generation

### Template-Based Generation
- **Pros**: Fast, predictable, no external dependencies
- **Cons**: Limited flexibility, poor handling of edge cases, not truly AI-powered
- **Rejection Reason**: Doesn't demonstrate AI capabilities as required by project scope

## Implementation Strategy

### API Integration
```python
# Claude API integration through Anthropic Python SDK
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic(api_key=os.getenv("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"))

async def generate_gherkin_story(feature_description: str) -> str:
    """Generate Gherkin user story from feature description using Claude"""
    prompt = f"""
    Convert this feature description into a well-formatted Gherkin user story:
    
    Feature: {feature_description}
    
    Please provide:
    1. A clear feature title
    2. Background context if needed
    3. Multiple scenarios with Given/When/Then steps
    4. Proper Gherkin syntax
    """
    
    response = await client.messages.create(
        model="claude-3-sonnet-20240229",
        max_tokens=1000,
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    )
    
    return response.content[0].text
```

### Error Handling
- Implement retry logic for transient API failures
- Provide human-readable error messages for API issues
- Cache successful responses to reduce API calls during development
- Fallback to template-based generation if API is unavailable

### Optimization
- Use appropriate Claude model (Haiku for speed, Sonnet for quality balance)
- Implement request caching for identical feature descriptions
- Optimize prompts for consistent output format
- Monitor usage to stay within rate limits

### Security
- Store API keys securely using environment variables
- Implement request validation to prevent prompt injection
- Log API usage for monitoring and debugging
