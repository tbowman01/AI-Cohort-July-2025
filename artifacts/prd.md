## 1. Executive Summary & Vision
This web application empowers software engineers to learn how to integrate AI into their development workflows. It provides interactive lessons, practical exercises, and progress tracking to help users master prompt engineering, code generation, AI-assisted debugging, and rapid prototyping. The vision is to create a trusted educational platform that helps developers become AI-augmented engineers who can build more efficiently and creatively.

## 2. The Problem

**2.1. Problem Statement:**
Software engineers face a steep learning curve when trying to adopt AI tools effectively. While there are many tutorials and blog posts, they lack structure, guidance, and hands-on integration into a developer’s workflow. This results in fragmented knowledge and limited practical application.

**2.2. User Personas & Scenarios:**

- **Persona 1: The Junior Developer**
  - Recently hired and wants to learn how to use AI tools to improve coding efficiency.
  - Needs structured lessons and concrete examples to bridge theory with practice.
  
- **Persona 2: The Senior Engineer**
  - Wants to prototype faster and explore new technologies but lacks time to explore scattered AI resources.
  - Needs quick, high-impact workflows and advanced use cases.

- **Persona 3: The Self-Taught Programmer**
  - Exploring career development opportunities and wants to gain skills in AI-assisted development.
  - Needs a motivating platform to learn, track progress, and gain confidence.

## 3. Goals & Success Metrics

| Goal | Key Performance Indicator (KPI) | Target |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Accelerate AI adoption in development | Percentage of users completing multiple lessons | 70% of active users complete at least 3 lessons |
| Encourage effective use of AI tools | Prompt improvement assessment (before/after) | 80% users improve prompt quality after Lesson 1 |
| Support skill retention | Quiz pass rate per module | ≥ 85% average score on lesson quizzes |
| Maintain user engagement | Return rate within 7 days | ≥ 60% of users return within 1 week |

## 4. Functional Requirements & User Stories

---
_Example Epic: Learning Modules_

* **Story 1.1:** As a user, I want to view a list of AI-related lessons, so that I can choose where to begin my learning journey.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        * Given I’m logged in, when I navigate to the “Lessons” page, then I see all available lessons with a brief description and progress status.

* **Story 1.2:** As a user, I want to track my lesson progress, so that I can resume where I left off and measure my advancement.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        * Given I’ve completed part of a lesson, when I return to it, then my progress is saved.

* **Story 1.3:** As a user, I want to take quizzes after each lesson, so that I can evaluate my understanding.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        * Given I finish a lesson, when I start the quiz, then I see at least 2 questions and receive feedback after answering.

* **Story 1.4:** As a user, I want to create an account and log in securely, so that my progress can be saved.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        * Given I am on the registration page, when I sign up with a username and email, then my user account is created and I’m logged in.
